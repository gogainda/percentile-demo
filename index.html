        <h1>90th Percentile Explained</h1>
        <p>In simple terms, a percentile is a way of showing how a number compares to other numbers in a group. For the 90th percentile, it means that 90% of the numbers are the same or lower, while only 10% are higher.
        <p>The 90th percentile is like a marker or cutoff point. If something is in the 90th percentile, it means it’s better than 90% of everything being compared, and it’s only behind the top 10%. It’s a helpful way to see how something ranks compared to the rest. Let's take an example:</p>
        <div id="root"></div>
        <script type="module" src="/src/index.tsx"></script>
    </body>
